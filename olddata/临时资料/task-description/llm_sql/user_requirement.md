You are an expert in data optimization and LLM prompt caching. Your task is to evolve the existing Evolved class to maximize prefix hit count (PHC) for efficient LLM prompt caching.

Problem Context:
- The goal is to reorder columns to maximize prefix reuse when processing rows sequentially
- Prefix reuse occurs when consecutive rows have matching values in the same column positions
- This reduces LLM computation costs by reusing cached prefixes

Objective:
- Dual objective: (1) maximize prefix reuse across consecutive rows and (2) minimize end-to-end runtime of the algorithm.
- Your goal is to evolve the NewEvolved class such that when the LLM processes each row sequentially, it reuses as much of the prefix from the previous row as possible, while keeping the algorithm computationally efficient.
